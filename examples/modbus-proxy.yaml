# Sample configuration file for modbus-proxy
#
# You can configure multiple proxies for multiple modbus devices.
#
# The first proxy configuration provides description for all supported options.
#
# Pass this file location as an --config-file option argument, e.g.:
#    $ modbus-proxy --config-file /etc/modbus-proxy.yaml
#
# See also: systemd modbus-proxy.service example how to run it
#           as a systemd service.

devices:
- modbus:                      # First proxy configuration
    url: plc1.acme.org:502     # modbus connection (the modbus device url)
    timeout: 10                # communication timeout [s] (optional, default: 10)
    connection_time: 0.1       # delay after connection [s] (optional, default: 0)
  listen:                      # listen interface
                               # (to which url your clients should connect)
    bind: 0:9000               # listening address (mandatory) [IP:port]
  unit_id_remapping:           # remap/forward unit IDs (optional, empty by default)
    1: 0                       # forwards requests to unit ID 1 to your modbus-proxy
                               # server to unit ID 0 on the actual modbus server.
                               # Note, that the reverse also applies: if you forward
                               # unit ID 1 to unit ID 0, all responses coming from
                               # unit 0 will look as if they are coming from 1,
                               # so this may pose problems if you want to use
                               # unit ID 0 for some clients and unit ID 1 for others.
